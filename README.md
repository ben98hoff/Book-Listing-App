# Book-Listing-App
This app was a project submission for Udacity's Android Basics NanoDegree.  This section of the NanoDegree introduced basic networking for android applications including APIs, creating and handling Http requests, and parsing JSON.  This application uses google books api,  searches google books by keyword and returns a list of books.
